Abstract


This is a web-based moral parenting platform that combines state-of-the-art technology with intuitive design to provide an unparalleled experience for non-biological Parents, Children, and Volunteers. There are no suitable platforms available at the moment that are focused on the moral improvement of the children. In this application, parents can keep communication with their children and teach them about moral values. Children can be able to show respect to their parents by sending gratitude letters at regular intervals. The social scenario of the underdeveloped country is very critical, especially for the poor family. The moral factors were mainly under consideration during the platform development. It is developed to deploy the platform in certain geographical areas. To make it work in a global platform a major improvement and resource will be required. 


Introduction 

Children in most cases learn by observing their parents or caregivers. Some children are deprived form this because they don’t have parents or their parents are so poor that they are struggling with their life and they have no time to give careful attention to their children. What if there is a place where a poor student can find a moral parent? A nonbiological parent who can help financially and do reciprocal duties for a child’s better future. This relationship demands restraint, self-sacrifice, and patience from the parents toward the child to develop a strong moral foundation that will serve them all through their lives.

The research is done mostly through evaluating different organization’s websites for example United Nations, ActionAgainstHunger, WorldHunger, FoodAidFoundation etc. Hunger and moral values are related. I found that Asia and Africa has more hunger teenagers and moral value is most vulnerable in Asia and Africa.

Business Model

The platform mostly will be used by non-profit organizations, so there is no direct business model is there. Some of the benefits this application can provide, 
1. This application will attract big donors or foundations to finance projects
2. Members of the organization will get a clear idea about what they are committing themselves to.
3. It will be easy to apply for a business loan.
