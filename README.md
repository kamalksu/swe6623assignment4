1. Introduction 

Children in most cases learn by observing their parents or caregivers. Some children are deprived form this because they don’t have parents or their parents are so poor that they are struggling with their life and they have no time to give careful attention to their children. What if there is a place where a poor student can find a moral parent? A nonbiological parent who can help financially and do reciprocal duties for a child’s better future. This relationship demands restraint, self-sacrifice, and patience from the parents toward the child to develop a strong moral foundation that will serve them all through their lives.

The research is done mostly through evaluating different organization’s websites for example United Nations, ActionAgainstHunger, WorldHunger, FoodAidFoundation etc. Hunger and moral values are related. I found that Asia and Africa has more hunger teenagers and moral value is most vulnerable in Asia and Africa.
